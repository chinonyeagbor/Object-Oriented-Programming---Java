# Object-Oriented-Programming---Java
A comprehensive software system demonstrating core object-oriented programming concepts, database integration, web functionality, and rigorous testing, developed to solve real-world problems efficiently.
Through this project, I achieved several key learning outcomes that showcase my skills in computational thinking, problem-solving, and software development:

LO1: Problem Solving with Computational Thinking
Applied computational thinking and programming techniques to devise efficient solutions to complex problems, establishing a strong foundation in software design and problem analysis.

LO2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Utilized OOP principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, in the design and implementation of classes and methods, ensuring modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

LO3: Debugging and Software Maintenance
Adopted a systematic approach to identifying, analyzing, and fixing defects, enhancing the reliability and robustness of the software.

LO4: Software Testing and Validation
Employed standard testing techniques to verify and validate code, using unit tests and test cases to confirm correctness and functionality.

Project Functionality
Core Classes and Functionality
The following classes and features were implemented, tested, and refined to meet the project requirements:

Product Class
✔ Fully implemented and tested with methods for product management.
Customer Class
✔ Fully implemented and tested, including an integrated Address class for complete customer data management.

Menu and Database Operations
The system provides extensive menu options for managing customers and products in the database:
✔ List all customers in the system
✔ Add, update, and delete customers
✔ Search for a customer by ID
✔ List all products in the system
✔ Add, update, and delete products
✔ Search for a product by ID

Web Functionality
The project includes web-based features for user-friendly data management via a web interface:
✔ Display all customers in the system
✔ Add, edit, and delete customer information
✔ Display all products in the system
✔ Add, edit, and delete product information

Advanced Features
Implemented advanced software functionalities to showcase my proficiency in specialized areas:
✔ Unit Testing: Comprehensive unit tests ensure code reliability and functionality.
✔ JavaDoc Documentation: Detailed documentation of classes and methods for easier maintenance and collaboration.
✔ No	Multiple Product types: Able to take multiple product type 

Planned but not implemented advanced features include:
❌ Shopping Basket and multiple product types
❌ Search and filter options for products
❌ Lambda expressions
❌ Design Patterns

Additional Information
Notes for Running the Code
To run the code effectively, follow the installation steps and prerequisites as outlined. 
-Enter 3 on the console to access the Web page. 
-Click on log in to access the admin page. 
-Click on log in again to access the Web Menus for Product, Customer and User. 

The Test cases are available to verify functionality, and JavaDoc documentation provides an in-depth explanation of the classes and methods.
